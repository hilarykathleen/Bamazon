# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront node application using sql database that takes in in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

A table displaying id, item description, price and quantity will display once initial node command has been made.  User will then be given the prompt for the Id they would like to purchase followed by a prompt for the quantity.  

Once the customer has placed their order, the appliation checks to see if item or items requested are in stock. If items are not available a prompt will appear notifying customer of insufficient stock and order will not process.  

If sufficient quantity is available product database will update and customer will be shown the details of their order including total cost and stock remaining.
